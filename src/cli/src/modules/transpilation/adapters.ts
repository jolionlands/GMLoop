/**
 * Dependency-inversion seam for the concrete parser and transpiler adapters
 * consumed by the CLI's high-level orchestration layers (watch, transpile,
 * graph commands, and the transpilation coordinator).
 *
 * Without this seam, the orchestration modules import `new Parser.GMLParser()`
 * and `new Transpiler.GmlTranspiler()` directly. That couples the CLI to two
 * concrete workspace classes, which makes it impossible to:
 *
 *   - Substitute the parser/transpiler in tests without monkey-patching the
 *     workspace exports.
 *   - Compose alternative implementations (e.g., a parser preprocessor or a
 *     transpiler wrapper that instruments patch payloads).
 *   - Audit a single place that defines the canonical production
 *     configuration for these adapters.
 *
 * The factory functions here wrap those `new` calls in a seam that orchestration
 * code can depend on. Tests and embedders can pass custom factory overrides
 * to the higher-level helpers (see `createGmlParserAdapter` / `createGmlTranspilerAdapter`)
 * to inject test doubles, mirroring the pattern established by
 * `src/cli/src/modules/refactor/bridge-factory.ts`.
 *
 * (target-state.md §2.1 — workspace public APIs; §2.2 — abstraction boundaries
 * over concrete adapter classes.)
