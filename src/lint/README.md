# @gmloop/lint

`@gmloop/lint` is the ESLint language plugin and rule bundle for GameMaker Language (`.gml`) in this monorepo.

It owns lint diagnostics and semantic/content rewrites (via lint rules and `--write`), while formatter-only layout behavior stays in `@gmloop/format`.

- Owns:
    - ESLint language wiring for GML (`language: "gml/gml"`)
    - Lint rules and single-file-safe autofix behavior. **Lint rule autofixes are responsible for fixing valid-but-forbidden syntax (e.g., style violations or deprecated patterns that are still syntactically valid).**
- Does not own:
    - Prettier formatting behavior (should not directly manipulate whitespace, semicolons, line breaks, indentation, etc.). **The formatter never repairs invalid syntax and only formats valid AST.** Should NOT depend on `@gmloop/format` or its internal APIs.
    - Parser internals/grammar ownership
    - Project-wide identifier indexing, rename safety, or hoist-name generation
    - Refactor transaction planning/execution. **Codemod/fixer commands are responsible for repairing non-parsable source text to restore parsability.**

See [../../docs/target-state.md](../../docs/target-state.md) for the split contract.

## Install and Peer Requirements

- Package: `@gmloop/lint`
- Peer dependency: `eslint` `>=9.39.0 <10`
- Runtime: Node `>=22`

## Quick Start (Flat Config)

```js
// eslint.config.js
import * as LintWorkspace from "@gmloop/lint";

export default [...LintWorkspace.Lint.configs.recommended];
```

This wires:

- `plugins.gml = Lint.plugin`
- `language = "gml/gml"`
- All recommended `gml/*` rule levels plus the conservative safe Feather subset
  (`gm1003`, `gm1009`, `gm1033`, `gm1041`, `gm1051`, `gm2007`, `gm2020`)

## Config Sets

`Lint.configs` exposes these immutable flat-config sets:

- `recommended`: all `gml/*` rules plus a conservative safe `feather/*` subset
- `feather`: `feather/gm####` overlay rules from the feather manifest

Example:

```js
import * as LintWorkspace from "@gmloop/lint";

export default [
    ...LintWorkspace.Lint.configs.recommended,
    ...LintWorkspace.Lint.configs.feather
];
```

For a full "all rules enabled" config (including all `feather/*` rules), see:
`docs/examples/example.eslint.all-rules.config.js`.

## Language Behavior

The plugin registers `gml/gml` as an ESLint v9 language implementation and returns parser services under `parserServices.gml`:

- `schemaVersion`
- `filePath`
- `recovery`
- `directives`
- `enums`

Recovery mode is controlled by language options:

- `recovery: "limited"` (default)
- `recovery: "none"`

## Public API

The workspace exports a single namespace:

```ts
import * as LintWorkspace from "@gmloop/lint";

LintWorkspace.Lint;
```

`Lint` contains:

- `plugin`: ESLint plugin object for `gml/*` (`rules`, `languages`)
- `featherPlugin`: ESLint plugin object for `feather/*` (`rules`)
- `configs`: `recommended`, `feather`
- `ruleIds`: PascalCase map keys to canonical full IDs (`gml/...`, `feather/...`)
- `services`: single-file-safe support values only; no project registries, project roots, or semantic indexes

## GML Rule IDs

Built-in `gml/*` rule short names:

- `prefer-hoistable-loop-accessors` (includes former `prefer-loop-length-hoist` scenarios)
- `prefer-loop-invariant-expressions`
- `prefer-repeat-loops`
- `prefer-struct-literal-assignments`
- `prefer-array-push`
- `prefer-compound-assignments`
- `prefer-increment-decrement-operators`
- `prefer-direct-return`
- `optimize-logical-flow`
- `no-globalvar`
- `no-empty-regions`
- `no-legacy-api`
- `no-scientific-notation`
- `no-unnecessary-string-interpolation`
- `remove-default-comments`
- `normalize-banner-comments`
- `normalize-doc-comments`
- `normalize-directives`
- `require-control-flow-braces`
- `require-region-pairs`
- `no-assignment-in-condition`
- `prefer-is-undefined-check`
- `prefer-epsilon-comparisons`
- `normalize-operator-aliases`
- `prefer-string-interpolation`
- `optimize-math-expressions`
- `require-argument-separators`
- `normalize-data-structure-accessors`
- `require-trailing-optional-defaults`
- `simplify-real-calls`

`prefer-compound-assignments` rewrites safe self-assignment forms
`x = x <op> y` to `x <op>= y` for arithmetic/bitwise operators that GML
actually supports in compound form, plus `??`. It never rewrites `x = x << y` or `x = x >> y`, because GML has no `<<=` or `>>=` operator.

`prefer-array-push` rewrites direct append assignments of the form
`array[array_length(array)] = value;` to `array_push(array, value);` when the
array receiver is side-effect-free and the replacement would stay within a
single standalone statement.

`prefer-increment-decrement-operators` rewrites standalone `+= 1` / `-= 1`
statements to `++` / `--` when the increment amount is a numeric literal equal to one. It intentionally skips `for` header update expressions and
comment-bearing statement spans.

`prefer-direct-return` rewrites adjacent local-return boilerplate from
`var value = expression; return value;` to `return expression;` when no comments would be dropped and the initializer does not reference the declared identifier.

`require-control-flow-braces` reports and autofixes unbraced control-flow statements by inserting structural `{ ... }` blocks. It does not depend on the formatter for that rewrite; the formatter remains responsible only for subsequent layout/canonical rendering.

`require-region-pairs` reports malformed `#region` / `#endregion` pairs. The autofix removes standalone `#endregion` directives and appends missing `#endregion` directives at the bottom of the file.

`prefer-struct-literal-assignments` only rewrites contiguous property assignments when they immediately follow an empty struct creation (`var foo = {};` or `foo = {};`). Property writes against existing structs are left unchanged.

`prefer-loop-invariant-expressions` hoists a single side-effect-free, loop-invariant expression into a cached `var` declared immediately before the loop. Equivalent occurrences inside the same loop reuse that single cache declaration, and later lint passes skip re-hoisting the synthetic `cached_*` initializers into ancestor loops. The rule is intentionally conservative: it skips unknown calls, non-deterministic reads (for example `current_time`), dynamic DS/map accessors, and member/index reads that could be invalidated by loop-local mutations or impure calls.

`remove-default-comments` removes default GameMaker placeholder and migration-banner comments.

`no-legacy-api` reports deprecated built-ins and auto-fixes safe local direct
renames, including deprecated replacements that were historically surfaced
through Feather parity rules. Structural or project-wide migrations remain
report-only and continue to belong in lint diagnostics or explicit refactor
commands rather than unsafe autofixes.

`normalize-banner-comments` canonicalizes decorative banner comments (line and block forms) and rewrites method-list `///` banner lines (outside of function declarations) to plain `//` comments.

`normalize-doc-comments` canonicalizes doc tags/content within a single file, including removing `@param` separator hyphens (for example, `@param value - desc` to `@param value desc`). It synthesizes missing tags for declaration/assignment-style function docs. Constructors, including for inherited constructors (`function X(...) : Parent(...) constructor`). For struct/object literal property functions, the rule synthesizes docs, including `@returns`. Canonical ordering keeps non-param metadata tags before the param block, but preserves custom tags interleaved between `@param` lines when intentionally authored that way.

`normalize-data-structure-accessors` only applies repairs when the syntax or surrounding code provides enough evidence. Multi-coordinate structured access is normalized to `[# ...]`, because grids are the only GameMaker data structure that support more than one coordinate. The rule intentionally does not guess list/map accessors from variable naming conventions, and any constructor-based accessor provenance is cleared immediately when the tracked variable is reassigned.

`normalize-operator-aliases` is intentionally syntax-safety scoped: it repairs invalid `not` keyword usage to `!` in executable code (while skipping uses in comments and string literals), and avoids style rewrites.
Logical operator style normalization (`&&`/`||`/`^^` vs `and`/`or`/`xor`) belongs to the formatter (`@gmloop/format`, `logicalOperatorsStyle`), so lint does not rewrite those forms.

`optimize-logical-flow` condenses boolean passthrough branches (for example `if (cond) return true; return false;`) into direct returns and rewrites undefined guard assignments (`if (is_undefined(x)) x = y;` / `if (x == undefined) x = y;`) into `x ??= y;` when it is safe. Comment-bearing ranges are intentionally skipped so autofixes never strip authored comments while optimizing nearby comment-free logic.
`optimize-logical-flow` and `optimize-math-expressions` clone candidate AST fragments using a traversal-link-stripping helper (skipping `parent`/context pointers) so autofix performance remains stable on very large scripts.
`prefer-loop-invariant-expressions` memoizes subtree hoistability checks per loop, caches normalized in-scope identifier names across loop iterations, reuses a single replacement target set for equivalent invariant expressions, and uses indexed comment-token range checks so large loop-heavy files avoid repeated full-source rescans.
`optimize-math-expressions` only performs reciprocal-term cancellation on side-effect-free operands (identifiers/member accesses/literals). Call-expression operands are intentionally excluded from that cancellation path.
`simplify-real-calls` detects calls to GML's built-in `real()` function that take a single string literal argument whose content is a valid numeric literal, and replaces the entire call expression with just the numeric literal. E.g. `real("0.5")` → `0.5`. This rewrite is safe because `real()` with a string literal argument is deterministic and has no observable side effects.

Feather rules are exposed as `feather/gm####` and sourced from `Lint.services.featherManifest`. All feather-namespace lint rules follow the naming pattern `feather/gm####`, where the lint rule diagnoses/fixes specificy/only the issue for the associated Feather rule/diagnostic. For example, lint rule `feather/gm1000` identifies and fixes the specific issue described in Feather rule `gm1000`: "No enclosing loop from which to break" This creates a clear, traceable link between each Feather rule and its corresponding lint rule(s), and allows us to easily add new lint rules for new Feather rules as they are added to the manifest.

`feather/gm1010` uses a conservative numeric-casting strategy: it only wraps `num*` identifiers with `real(...)` when they are directly added to a numeric literal (for example, `5 + numFive`), and leaves mixed string-concatenation chains untouched.

## Development

```bash
pnpm --filter @gmloop/lint run build:types
pnpm --filter @gmloop/lint run test
```

Performance-sensitive autofix rules also have dedicated regression coverage under [`test/rules/optimized-autofix-performance.test.ts`](test/rules/optimized-autofix-performance.test.ts). Those tests run as part of the normal compiled Node test suite, so CI enforces both fix correctness and the current runtime budgets for the measured hot paths.

## TODO

- **BUG**: When lint-fixing is run through the GMLoop CLI, if no eslint configuration file is detected in the target GameMaker project, the CLI should fall back to a default, "recommended" ruleset.
- **FEAT**: Add a new "all" lint ruleset config that includes all `gml/*` and `feather/*` rules at their recommended levels (either "warn" or "error"), so users can easily enable every lint rule with a single config spread.
- The structure/files of `src/lint/src/doc-comment` is confusing and disorganized. Would a flat structure be better where we move files in 'src/lint/src/doc-comment/service' up one level?
- Add an ESLint auto-fix rule that detects simple numeric accumulation loops like `alpha += index` over a fixed range and replaces them with the equivalent arithmetic-series expression. Example: `for index = 0..9` can become `alpha += count * (count - 1) * 0.5`, avoiding unnecessary runtime iteration.
- **BUG**: Split the large, multi-purpose `optimize-logical-flow` rule into multiple focused rules that each target a specific logical optimization pattern
- **BUG**: As of 6/6/2026, we seem to have circular lint fixes somewhere:
  ```
  (node:89657) ESLintCircularFixesWarning: Circular fixes detected while fixing /Users/henrykirk/Desktop/CannonFatherSource/cannonfather/scripts/group_draw_sprite/group_draw_sprite.gml. It is likely that you have conflicting rules in your configuration.
  ```
  We should also ensure to NOT have any lint auto-fix rules that conflict. If one of our "gml/" lint rules conflicts with a "feather/" lint rule, the "gml/" auto-fix should take precedence and we should make the "feather/" rule **strictly report-only**.
