 * (resolving a source offset to a 1-based line/column location, locating the
 * end of the brace block that opens at a given index, …). Reaching two
 * directory levels into the gml/ rules folder for those helpers would couple
 * consumers to the internal layout of the gml/ domain; this facade keeps
 * that coupling isolated to this file so the gml/ rule subtree can be
 * reorganised without churning every feather rule import.
 *
 * Only helpers whose consumers cross the gml/ domain boundary belong here;
 * helpers used exclusively inside the gml/ rules folder should continue to
 * be imported from `./rule-base-helpers.js` directly.
