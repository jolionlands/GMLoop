/**
 * Policy layer for logical-expression condensation.
 *
 * This module extracts all **policy decisions** — thresholds, heuristics, and
 * conditional rules — from the condensation mechanism code.  By keeping the
 * two layers separate:
 *
 * 1. Policy logic is testable in isolation without AST mutations.
 * 2. Thresholds can be adjusted without touching transformation code.
 * 3. Callers can inspect or override policy outcomes before committing changes.
 *
 * The policy provides a single pure evaluator: `evaluateTruthTablePolicy`.
 * It answers "should the condensation attempt to build a truth table?" based on
 * the number of boolean variables discovered in the condition expression.
