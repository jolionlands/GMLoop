# @gmloop/ui

`@gmloop/ui` is the monorepo workspace that owns cross-project user interfaces for GMLoop.

The workspace exists to keep UI code separate from domain logic. The long-term scope includes:

- graph-index visualizations
- AST preview surfaces
- CLI documentation views
- MCP tool browsers
- formatter, lint, and refactor rule explorers
- project fix, format, refactor/codemod, and lint workflow launchers
- live-reload observability
- other cross-workspace dashboards and inspectors

The implemented v1 contract is now:

- producing workspaces own data/view-model generation
- `@gmloop/ui` owns typed renderers and client interaction code
- host layers such as `@gmloop/cli` own write/serve/regenerate lifecycle

## Goals

- Provide a single UI workspace for all product-facing views instead of embedding UI logic into `@gmloop/cli`, `@gmloop/semantic`, `@gmloop/lint`, or other functional workspaces.
- Keep functionality workspaces free of UI dependencies.
- Reuse existing workspace behavior through explicit delegation instead of reimplementing parser, semantic, CLI, lint, formatter, refactor, or MCP logic inside the UI layer.
- Establish a stable convention for future UI tabs and visualizations.

## Ownership Boundary

`@gmloop/ui` owns:

- rendering HTML, CSS, and client-side interaction code
- view state, local filtering, local toggles, and presentational interaction behavior
- composition of already-produced data into user-facing interfaces
- UI-specific affordances such as loading indicators, tab shells, inspector panels, and view switching
- typed rendering contracts for UI surfaces

`@gmloop/ui` does not own:

- graph indexing
- semantic analysis
- AST generation
- lint rule execution
- formatting
- refactor planning or mutation
- CLI command parsing
- HTTP server lifecycle
- MCP tool discovery or execution
- runtime-wrapper patch application
- hot-reload watch, transpile, or WebSocket server lifecycle

That logic must remain in the existing functional workspaces.

## Delegation Contract

The UI workspace must consume functionality through workspace APIs rather than duplicating behavior.

The intended dependency direction is:

- `@gmloop/core`, `@gmloop/parser`, `@gmloop/semantic`, `@gmloop/lint`, `@gmloop/refactor`, `@gmloop/transpiler`, `@gmloop/mcp`, and `@gmloop/cli` expose domain APIs
- `@gmloop/ui` consumes serialized data, callbacks, or view models built from those APIs
- the functional workspaces must not import `@gmloop/ui`

For the first iteration:

- `@gmloop/semantic` owns graph-export data generation
- `@gmloop/cli` owns `graph visualize` command orchestration, file output, server mode, and regeneration endpoints
- `@gmloop/ui` owns the graph visualization renderer and browser interaction behavior
- Included-file resources under `datafiles/**` are rendered as `data_file` nodes. `.gml`, `.yy`, and `.yyp` paths may be shown as node provenance, but they are not standalone graph nodes.
- The graph legend shows every supported user-facing node kind, including absent resource categories such as sounds, particles, timelines, and tile sets. Internal project nodes and obsolete generic file nodes are not filterable legend entries. `Resource` is a colorless organizational parent for concrete resource kinds, not a graph node kind.

This pattern should remain the template for future UI surfaces:

1. A functional workspace exposes a narrow, testable data API.
2. `@gmloop/cli` or another orchestration layer handles command/server lifecycle when needed.
3. `@gmloop/ui` renders that data without recreating the source logic.

## Implemented Contract

The current graph UI uses a typed bundle-render boundary and a Lit component shell.

- `renderGraphVisualizationBundle(data, options)` is the primary renderer entrypoint
- renderer output is a filesystem-ready artifact: `index.html` + local `assets/*` files
- bundle assets include the local Vite-built Lit shell and stylesheet assets (no CDN dependencies)
- CLI host code is responsible for obtaining payloads and writing/serving the emitted bundle artifact
- graph/docs/config tabs are rendered from live workspace-fed catalogs
- the Fix tab delegates configured refactor, lint, and format mutation to the CLI host, renders status/log output, and shows elapsed-time progress updates while runs are pending
- the Live Reload surface renders watcher, WebSocket, patch, latency, error, and optional runtime-wrapper health snapshots from UI-owned DTOs
- the Docs surface includes `CLI`, `MCP`, `Linting`, `Formatting`, and `Codemods` subviews for command, tool, and workspace rule catalogs
- loaded project state is shown in one canonical header location and reflects the active graph/config context
- graph/docs/config/fix/playground/MCP/live-reload page state, docs subview state, graph view mode, label mode, and search query are shareable through URL query params

## Design Rules

- UI modules should accept explicit data payloads and configuration inputs.
- UI modules should not reach into parser, semantic, lint, or refactor internals.
- UI modules should avoid hidden side effects and should be render-oriented.
- When a UI needs new data, add a narrow API to the owning workspace rather than copying the logic into `@gmloop/ui`.
- When a UI needs a new action, the action should be implemented by the owning workspace or orchestration layer and surfaced into the UI as a callback, endpoint, or serialized contract.
- Keep UI feature code organized by surface or domain, for example `graph/`, `ast/`, `cli-docs/`, `mcp/`, `rules/`.
- Maintain a canonical top-level surface catalog in code so future UI tabs are discoverable and consistently named.

## Template Whitespace Rules

Lit templates are whitespace-sensitive for inline elements (elements that receive their content through `html` interpolation without child nodes). Any indentation or newlines between an opening tag and its closing tag become text nodes in the rendered DOM. This produces unwanted visual padding and can break assumptions in styling.

Symptoms include visible extra padding in output panes, mismatch with `white-space: pre` layouts, and broken test assertions like `doesNotMatch(rendered, /<element>\s+\S/u)`.

The rule: for inline elements where content is provided via interpolation, keep the `html` template on a single line with no leading or trailing whitespace:

```ts
// ✅ Correct — no whitespace between opening and closing tags
return html`<div class="output">${content}</div>`;

// ❌ Incorrect — indentation becomes a text node, visible in the rendered output
return html`<div class="output">
    ${content}
</div>`;
```

When a template must be broken across multiple lines (e.g., for readability), extract the element into a private class method or module-level helper that returns the complete `TemplateResult` on a single line. See `GmPlaygroundPanel.#renderOutput` and its test "playground panel output does not have leading whitespace nodes" for a reference implementation.

## Workspace Structure

The current workspace structure is:

```text
src/ui/
  index.ts
  package.json
  README.md
  tsconfig.json
  src/
    index.ts
    app/
      index.ts
      bootstrap.ts
      components/
      state/
    surfaces/
      index.ts
    web/
      index.html
      main.ts
      register-components.ts
      styles/
    graph/
      index.ts
      graph-visualization-inline-data.ts
      graph-visualization-style-metadata.ts
      graph-visualization-bundle.ts
      graph-viewport.ts
      types.ts
  vite.config.ts
  test/
    graph-visualization-bundle.test.ts
    ui-surfaces.test.ts
```

This keeps the public API explicit while leaving room for additional UI domains.

## Graph Visualization Split

The graph visualization surface is split as:

- `@gmloop/semantic`: exports the graph visualization payload
- `@gmloop/ui`: owns Lit components, graph rendering, CSS assets, and bundle rendering contracts
- `@gmloop/cli`: chooses whether to write or serve the UI bundle, owns the HTTP host server, owns regeneration endpoints, and owns native file-picker integration

That separation is intentional and should be preserved as more UI surfaces are added.

## Shared Status Badges

`gm-status-chip` is the shared status badge for feature-page health and lifecycle state. Feature pages must select one of the component's supported statuses instead of passing arbitrary label text, so copy and styling remain consistent across surfaces.

Each tab has one top-level page toolbar. That toolbar owns the page title, subtitle, page-level status badge, and any main controls for the current tab. Do not add a second hero/header toolbar inside a page body for the same title or controls. MCP and Live Reload status badges belong in the shared page toolbar title row, Live Reload start/open/stop controls belong in that same toolbar, and Docs subview/search controls belong in the shared toolbar instead of the Docs panel body. Docs subview tabs use the shared `gm-view-selector` tab control so CLI, MCP, Linting, Formatting, Codemods, Playground, and Config selectors keep one visual treatment.

## Live Reload Surface

The Live Reload surface is observability-only. It displays data from the CLI status server and host-provided runtime-wrapper summaries without owning the hot-reload pipeline itself.

- `@gmloop/cli` owns file watching, transpilation orchestration, WebSocket patch streaming, and `/status`.
- `@gmloop/runtime-wrapper` owns browser-side patch application, queueing, rollback, registry state, and runtime diagnostics.
- `@gmloop/ui` owns the presentation model, automatic polling display, cards, recent patch/error lists, and optional runtime health rendering.

Hosts provide live-reload startup data through `GraphVisualizationRenderOptions.liveReload` and server-mode start/stop callbacks. Once a live-reload model includes a status URL, the Live Reload page updates status automatically by polling on a timer and by polling when the document becomes visible again. The Live Reload page must not expose a manual status-refresh button or host refresh callback; status freshness is owned by the timer/focus polling loop so the UI cannot drift into a separate manual-refresh state. In server mode, the Stop control is always rendered in the shared page toolbar and uses disabled state to communicate availability; it is enabled only while an active live-reload session exists. Starting Live Reload from the UI must complete build/startup sequencing before the runtime tab opens: the host start endpoint reports success only with a concrete runtime URL, and the browser opens that URL directly instead of reserving an `about:blank` placeholder tab. UI starts use start-or-reuse semantics instead of forced restart semantics so a healthy existing watcher/status/runtime session is adopted instead of spawning a duplicate process into occupied ports; when a new watcher child is required, the graph server assigns per-session status and WebSocket ports and polls those exact endpoints instead of binding the fixed default ports. UI hot reloads from Vite or the served-UI revision watcher must preserve the host-owned game Live Reload session. Start and stop callbacks mirror the active live-reload model into the web bootstrap payload so a UI remount cannot show stale "not running" controls while the watcher process is still active.

## Serve Host Contract

`@gmloop/ui` does not invoke native dialogs or perform local filesystem selection itself. The host workspace provides that behavior and passes loaded-target metadata into the renderer.

The shipped `graph visualize` bundle and development web entry both mount the same Lit shell. That single path owns graph/docs/config/fix/playground/MCP/live-reload rendering and must preserve the same user-facing navigation contract in export and serve modes.

Current graph serve-mode host actions are:

- `POST /api/reindex`: force-regenerate the current graph index
- `POST /api/open`: switch the active UI project globally, optionally using a caller-supplied `path`
- `POST /api/fix`: run the requested `fix`, `format`, `refactor`, or `lint` project workflow in write mode and return log lines for the Fix tab
- `GET /api/fix/progress`: return the latest in-flight fix workflow log lines so the Fix tab can live-update while work is running
- `POST /api/live-reload/start`: build and start the configured live-reload pipeline, then return the latest live-reload model

The host serves the bundle entry document and static asset files, while `@gmloop/ui` remains responsible for typed rendering contracts and client presentation behavior.

## Surface Convention

The canonical current and planned top-level UI surfaces are tracked in code through `UI_SURFACE_DEFINITIONS`.

- `graph`: implemented
- `ast`: planned
- `config`: implemented
- `docs`: implemented
- `fix`: implemented
- `live-reload`: implemented
- `mcp`: implemented
- `playground`: implemented
- `rules`: planned

New top-level UI additions should:

1. Add a stable surface id to the catalog.
2. Add a dedicated `src/<surface>/` domain directory.
3. Consume data only from the owning functional workspace or orchestration layer.
4. Avoid recreating parser, semantic, lint, refactor, CLI, or MCP logic inside `@gmloop/ui`.

## TODO
- **BUG**: Selecting *any* format option in the `Playground` tab/page for the format settings seems to enable the whole/default format settings too, not *just* that one control. Also not sure if the select-options are actually hooked up to live-update the playground's output view?
- **FEAT**: For the playground tab/page, user should be able to select *any* of the 'golden' fixture .gml files to preview/test. Or, maybe this is only true if np project is opened in the UI. If a GameMaker project *is* opened in the UI, then the user could be able to select on of the .gml files from that project and test applying rules to those instead.
- **FEAT**: For all raw-JSON displayed in the UI, add a "copy to clipboard" button (single, reusable component) that copies the raw JSON string to the clipboard for easy external use.
- **FEAT**: For all raw-JSON displayed in the UI, allow for collapsing/expanding nested objects and arrays for easier readability.
- **BUG**: On the "Docs" page/tab, the search bar and its subtitle "Search current docs view" are misaligned from the toolbar's subtabs-component (CLI, MCP, etc.). The search bar should be visually aligned vertically with that subtab component.
- **BUG**: On the "Docs" page/tab, when typing in the search bar, it does not allow certain characters like "r" to be typed (maybe those that are also used as hotkeys for the UI?). The search bar should allow all characters to be typed, and hotkeys should not interfere with typing in the search bar.
- **BUG**: In the UI's navigation, instead of disabling the "Graph Index" menu-item/option tab/page when the opened project does not have a graph index, it should still be selectable since the user can generate it on that tab/page.
- **BUG**: When the GMLoop UI is served locally w/ live-reloading, when the UI code is changed and hot-reloads and the "Apply Fixes" fix-workflow is in-progress (on the "Fix" page/tab), the progress/state is reset/discarded when the UI hot-reloads. The fix workflow progress/state should be preserved across UI hot-reloads, so if the user is in the middle of a long-running fix workflow and makes a change to the UI code, they won't lose their place in the fix workflow and can continue to monitor its progress without interruption. Its possible it is still running in the background and the UI just loses the connection to it, so maybe we just need to re-establish the connection to the in-flight workflow after hot-reload instead of losing all progress/state.
- **FEAT**: In the UI's "Fix" page/tab (also probably the CLI output since they should be the same), it is unclear if/when GMLoop is rebuilding/updating the semantic-index. It just shows `[1/3 Refactor Codemods]... [namingConvention] running...` for a long time but we want some more visibility into when the semantic index is being updated, since that is a critical part of the process and can take a long time for larger projects. We should add some explicit log/status messages to indicate when the semantic index is being created/rebuilt/updated, and ideally also show progress updates for that step if possible (e.g. "Updating semantic index... [n%]").
- **FEAT**: In the UI's "Fix" page/tab we should have a way/button to stop/cancel an in-flight fix workflow, in case the user accidentally starts a fix workflow or realizes they need to change their fix configuration before starting the workflow
